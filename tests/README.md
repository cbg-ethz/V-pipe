# Automated test datasets

This directory contains small test datasets which are used for the automated testing of V-pipe as part of the development process.

The workflow tests that are automatically performed upon each update on GitHub can be found in the [`.github/workflows` directory](../.github/workflows).

## Tutorials

If you want to test your new V-pipe installation, we strongly encourage you to instead check our tutorials which provide real example data.

Tutorials for your first steps with V-pipe for different scenarios are available in the [docs/](../docs/README.md) subdirectory.
