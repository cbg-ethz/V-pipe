    abstract = {The genetic diversity of virus populations within their hosts is known to influence disease progression, treatment outcome, drug resistance, cell tropism, and transmission risk, and the study of dynamic changes of genetic heterogeneity can provide insights into the evolution of viruses. Several measures to quantify within-host genetic diversity capturing different aspects of diversity patterns in a sample or population are used, based on incidence, relative frequencies, pairwise distances, or phylogenetic trees. Here, we review and compare several of these measures.}

This clustering problem is solved in a Bayesian fashion using the Dirichlet process mixture to define a prior distribution on the unknown number of haplotypes in the mixture. We devise a Gibbs sampler for sampling from the joint posterior distribution of haplotype sequences, assignment of reads to haplotypes, and error rate of the sequencing process, to obtain estimates of the local haplotype structure of the population.

The high coverage achievable with these methods enables the detection of many low-frequency variants. However, sequencing errors complicate the analysis of mixed populations and result in inflated estimates of genetic diversity. We developed a probabilistic Bayesian approach to minimize the effect of errors on the detection of minority variants. We applied it to pyrosequencing data obtained from a 1.5‐kb-fragment of the HIV-1 gag/pol gene in two control and two clinical samples. The effect of PCR amplification was analysed. Error correction resulted in a two- and five-fold decrease of the pyrosequencing base substitution rate, from 0.05\\% to 0.03\\% and from 0.25\\% to 0.05\\% in the non-PCR and PCR-amplified samples, respectively. We were able to detect viral clones as rare as 0.1\\% with perfect sequence reconstruction. Probabilistic haplotype inference outperforms the counting-based calling method in both precision and recall. Genetic diversity observed within and between two clinical samples resulted in various patterns of phenotypic drug resistance and suggests a close epidemiological link. We conclude that pyrosequencing can be used to investigate genetically diverse samples with high accuracy if technical errors are properly treated. }",

    abstract = {Virus populations can display high genetic diversity within individual hosts. The intra-host collection of viral haplotypes, called viral quasispecies, is an important determinant of virulence, pathogenesis, and treatment outcome. We present HaploClique, a computational approach to reconstruct the structure of a viral quasispecies from next-generation sequencing data as obtained from bulk sequencing of mixed virus samples. We develop a statistical model for paired-end reads accounting for mutations, insertions, and deletions. Using an iterative maximal clique enumeration approach, read pairs are assembled into haplotypes of increasing length, eventually enabling global haplotype assembly. The performance of our quasispecies assembly method is assessed on simulated data for varying population characteristics and sequencing technology parameters. Owing to its paired-end handling, HaploClique compares favorably to state-of-the-art haplotype inference methods. It can reconstruct error-free full-length haplotypes from low coverage samples and detect large insertions and deletions at low frequencies. We applied HaploClique to sequencing data derived from a clinical hepatitis C virus population of an infected patient and discovered a novel deletion of length 357±167 bp that was validated by two independent long-read sequencing experiments. HaploClique is available at https://github.com/armintoepfer/haploclique. A summary of this paper appears in the proceedings of the RECOMB 2014 conference, April 2-5. },

	abstract = {The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 mutants with altered transmissibility, virulence, or immunogenicity emphasizes the need for early detection and epidemiological surveillance of genomic variants. Wastewater samples provide an opportunity to assess circulating viral lineages in the community. We performed genomic sequencing of 122 wastewater samples from three locations in Switzerland to analyze the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 variants of SARS-CoV-2 on a population level. We called variant-specific signature mutations and monitored variant prevalence in the local population over time. To enable early detection of emerging variants, we developed a bioinformatics tool that uses read pairs carrying multiple signature mutations as a robust indicator of low-frequency variants. We further devised a statistical approach to estimate the transmission fitness advantage, a key epidemiological parameter indicating the speed at which a variant spreads through the population, and compared the wastewater-based findings to those derived from clinical samples. We found that the local outbreak of the B.1.1.7 variant in two Swiss cities was observable in wastewater up to 8 days before its first detection in clinical samples. We detected a high prevalence of the B.1.1.7 variant in an alpine ski resort popular among British tourists in December 2020, a time when the variant was still very rare in Switzerland. We found no evidence of local spread of the B.1.351 and P.1 variants at the monitored locations until the end of the study (mid February) which is consistent with clinical samples. Estimation of local variant prevalence performs equally well or better for wastewater samples as for a much larger number of clinical samples. We found that the transmission fitness advantage of B.1.1.7, i.e. the relative change of its reproductive number, can be estimated earlier and based on substantially fewer wastewater samples as compared to using clinical samples. Our results show that genomic sequencing of wastewater samples can detect, monitor, and evaluate genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2 on a population level. Our methodology provides a blueprint for rapid, unbiased, and cost-efficient genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics as a Competitive Resource, the Swiss National Science Foundation Special Call on Coronaviruses 31CA30 196538), Swiss Federal Office of Public Health, Eawag discretionary funds and an EPFL COVID19 grant.

	abstract = {The SARS-CoV-2 lineages B.1.1.7 and 501.V2, which were first detected in the United Kingdom and South Africa, respectively, are spreading rapidly in the human population. Thus, there is an increased need for genomic and epidemiological surveillance in order to detect the strains and estimate their abundances. Here, we report a genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in 48 raw wastewater samples collected from three wastewater treatment plants in Switzerland between July 9 and December 21, 2020. We find evidence for the presence of several mutations that define the B.1.1.7 and 501.V2 lineages in some of the samples, including co-occurrences of up to three B.1.1.7 signature mutations on the same amplicon in four samples from Lausanne and one sample from a Swiss ski resort dated December 9 - 21. These findings suggest that the B.1.1.7 strain could be detected by mid December, two weeks before its first verification in a patient sample from Switzerland. We conclude that sequencing SARS-CoV-2 in community wastewater samples may help detect and monitor the circulation of diverse lineages.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics as a Competitive Resource, the Swiss National Science Foundation (project 31CA30 196538), Eawag discretionary funds and an EPFL COVID19 grant.

	abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, wastewater-based epidemiology has progressively taken a central role as a pathogen surveillance tool. Tracking viral loads and variant outbreaks in sewage offers advantages over clinical surveillance methods by providing unbiased estimates and enabling early detection. However, wastewater-based epidemiology poses new computational research questions that need to be solved in order for this approach to be implemented broadly and successfully. Here, we address the variant deconvolution problem, where we aim to estimate the relative abundances of genomic variants from next-generation sequencing data of a mixed wastewater sample. We introduce LolliPop, a computational method to solve the variant deconvolution problem by simultaneously solving least squares problems and kernel-based smoothing of relative variant abundances from wastewater time series sequencing data. We derive multiple approaches to compute confidence bands, and demonstrate the application of our method to data from the Swiss wastewater surveillance efforts.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementPart of this study was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant No. CRSII5_205933).
