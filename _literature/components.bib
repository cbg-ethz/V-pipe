The set of reads obtained from a deep sequencing experiment represents a statistical sample of the underlying population. We develop a generative probabilistic model for assigning observed reads to unobserved haplotypes in the presence of sequencing errors. This clustering problem is solved in a Bayesian fashion using the Dirichlet process mixture to define a prior distribution on the unknown number of haplotypes in the mixture. We devise a Gibbs sampler for sampling from the joint posterior distribution of haplotype sequences, assignment of reads to haplotypes, and error rate of the sequencing process, to obtain estimates of the local haplotype structure of the population. The method is evaluated on simulated data and on experimental deep sequencing data obtained from HIV samples.},

    abstract = "{ Next-generation sequencing technologies can be used to analyse genetically heterogeneous samples at unprecedented detail. The high coverage achievable with these methods enables the detection of many low-frequency variants. However, sequencing errors complicate the analysis of mixed populations and result in inflated estimates of genetic diversity. We developed a probabilistic Bayesian approach to minimize the effect of errors on the detection of minority variants. We applied it to pyrosequencing data obtained from a 1.5‐kb-fragment of the HIV-1 gag/pol gene in two control and two clinical samples. The effect of PCR amplification was analysed. Error correction resulted in a two- and five-fold decrease of the pyrosequencing base substitution rate, from 0.05\\% to 0.03\\% and from 0.25\\% to 0.05\\% in the non-PCR and PCR-amplified samples, respectively. We were able to detect viral clones as rare as 0.1\\% with perfect sequence reconstruction. Probabilistic haplotype inference outperforms the counting-based calling method in both precision and recall. Genetic diversity observed within and between two clinical samples resulted in various patterns of phenotypic drug resistance and suggests a close epidemiological link. We conclude that pyrosequencing can be used to investigate genetically diverse samples with high accuracy if technical errors are properly treated. }",

    title = {Viral Quasispecies Assembly via Maximal Clique Enumeration},
    author = {Armin T\"{o}pfer and Tobias Marschall and Rowena A. Bull and Fabio Luciani and Alexander Sch\"{o}nhuth and Niko Beerenwinkel},
    abstract = {Virus populations can display high genetic diversity within individual hosts. The intra-host collection of viral haplotypes, called viral quasispecies, is an important determinant of virulence, pathogenesis, and treatment outcome. We present HaploClique, a computational approach to reconstruct the structure of a viral quasispecies from next-generation sequencing data as obtained from bulk sequencing of mixed virus samples. We develop a statistical model for paired-end reads accounting for mutations, insertions, and deletions. Using an iterative maximal clique enumeration approach, read pairs are assembled into haplotypes of increasing length, eventually enabling global haplotype assembly. The performance of our quasispecies assembly method is assessed on simulated data for varying population characteristics and sequencing technology parameters. Owing to its paired-end handling, HaploClique compares favorably to state-of-the-art haplotype inference methods. It can reconstruct error-free full-length haplotypes from low coverage samples and detect large insertions and deletions at low frequencies. We applied HaploClique to sequencing data derived from a clinical hepatitis C virus population of an infected patient and discovered a novel deletion of length 357±167 bp that was validated by two independent long-read sequencing experiments. HaploClique is available at https://github.com/armintoepfer/haploclique. A summary of this paper appears in the proceedings of the RECOMB 2014 conference, April 2-5. },
