Fractions of ambiguous nucleotides, obtained by population sequencing, were available for 207 samples. We assessed whether the average pairwise diversity calculated using NGS sequences provided a more exact prediction of the time since infection and classification of infection recency (\\&lt;1 year after infection), compared with the fraction of ambiguous nucleotides.NGS-derived average pairwise diversity classified an infection as recent with a sensitivity of 88\\% and a specificity of 85\\%. When considering only the 207 samples for which fractions of ambiguous nucleotides were available, the NGS-derived average pairwise diversity exhibited a higher sensitivity (90\\% vs 78\\%) and specificity (95\\% vs 67\\%) than the fraction of ambiguous nucleotides. Additionally, the average pairwise diversity could be used to estimate the time since infection with a mean absolute error of 0.84 years, compared with 1.03 years for the fraction of ambiguous nucleotides.Viral diversity based on NGS data is more precise than that based on population sequencing in its ability to predict infection recency and provides an estimated time since infection that has a mean absolute error of \\&lt;1 year.}",

In addition to this diversity of consensus genomes across patients, RNA viruses can also display genetic diversity within individual hosts, and co-existing viral variants may affect disease progression and the success of medical interventions. To systematically examine the intra-patient genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2, we processed a large cohort of 3939 publicly-available deeply sequenced genomes with specialised bioinformatics software, along with 749 recently sequenced samples from Switzerland. We found that the distribution of diversity across patients and across genomic loci is very unbalanced with a minority of hosts and positions accounting for much of the diversity. For example, the D614G variant in the Spike gene, which is present in the consensus sequences of 67.4\% of patients, is also highly diverse within hosts, with 29.7\% of the public cohort being affected by this coexistence and exhibiting different variants. We also investigated the impact of several technical and epidemiological parameters on genetic heterogeneity and found that age, which is known to be correlated with poor disease outcomes, is a significant predictor of viral genetic diversity.},

Its additional value in monitoring SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the population and identifying newly arising variants independently of diagnostic testing is now undisputed. As a proof of concept, we report here correlations between SARS-CoV-2 detection in wastewater and the officially recorded COVID-19 case numbers, as well as the validity of such surveillance to detect emerging variants, exemplified by the detection of the B.1.1.529 variant Omicron in Basel, Switzerland.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;METHODS: From July 1 to December 31, 2021, wastewater samples were collected six times a week from the inflow of the local wastewater treatment plant that receives wastewater from the catchment area of the city of Basel, Switzerland, comprising 273,075 inhabitants. The number of SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies was determined by reverse transcriptase-quantitative PCR. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients were calculated to determine correlations with the median seven-day incidence of genome copies per litre of wastewater and official case data. To explore delayed correlation effects between the seven-day median number of genome copies/litre wastewater and the median seven-day incidence of SARS-CoV-2 cases, time-lagged Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients were calculated for up to 14 days. RNA extracts from daily wastewater samples were used to genotype circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants by next-generation sequencing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;RESULTS: The number of daily cases and the median seven-day incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the catchment area showed a high correlation with SARS-CoV-2 measurements in wastewater samples. All correlations between the seven-day median number of genome copies/litre wastewater and the time-lagged median seven-day incidence of SARS-CoV-2 cases were significant (p&amp;amp;lt;0.001) for the investigated lag of up to 14 days. Correlation coefficients declined constantly from the maximum of 0.9395 on day 1 to the minimum of 0.8016 on day 14. The B.1.1.529 variant Omicron was detected in wastewater samples collected on November 21, 2021, before its official acknowledgement in a clinical sample by health authorities.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;CONCLUSIONS: In this proof-of-concept study, wastewater-based epidemiology proved a reliable and sensitive surveillance approach, complementing routine clinical testing for mapping COVID-19 pandemic dynamics and observing newly circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;}, number={2526}, journal={Swiss Medical Weekly}, author={Bagutti, Claudia and Alt Hug, Monica and Heim, Philippe and Maurer Pekerman, Laura and Ilg Hampe, Evelyn and Hübner, Philipp and Fuchs, Simon and Savic, Miodrag and Stadler, Tanja and Topolsky, Ivan and Icer Baykal, Pelin and Dreifuss, David and Beerenwinkel, Niko and Tschudin Sutter, Sarah}, year={2022}, month={Jun.}, pages={w30202}, PubMedID={35822578} }

	abstract = {Background
	In December 2020, the United Kingdom (UK) reported a SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern (VoC) which is now named B.1.1.7. Based on initial data from the UK and later data from other countries, this variant was estimated to have a transmission fitness advantage of around 40–80 % (Volz et al., 2021; Leung et al., 2021; Davies et al., 2021).
	Aim
	This study aims to estimate the transmission fitness advantage and the effective reproductive number of B.1.1.7 through time based on data from Switzerland.
	Methods
	We generated whole genome sequences from 11.8 % of all confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in Switzerland between 14 December 2020 and 11 March 2021. Based on these data, we determine the daily frequency of the B.1.1.7 variant and quantify the variant’s transmission fitness advantage on a national and a regional scale.
	Results
	We estimate B.1.1.7 had a transmission fitness advantage of 43–52 % compared to the other variants circulating in Switzerland during the study period. Further, we estimate B.1.1.7 had a reproductive number above 1 from 01 January 2021 until the end of the study period, compared to below 1 for the other variants. Specifically, we estimate the reproductive number for B.1.1.7 was 1.24 [1.07–1.41] from 01 January until 17 January 2021 and 1.18 [1.06–1.30] from 18 January until 01 March 2021 based on the whole genome sequencing data. From 10 March to 16 March 2021, once B.1.1.7 was dominant, we estimate the reproductive number was 1.14 [1.00–1.26] based on all confirmed cases. For reference, Switzerland applied more non-pharmaceutical interventions to combat SARS-CoV-2 on 18 January 2021 and lifted some measures again on 01 March 2021.
	Conclusion
	The observed increase in B.1.1.7 frequency in Switzerland during the study period is as expected based on observations in the UK. In absolute numbers, B.1.1.7 increased exponentially with an estimated doubling time of around 2–3.5 weeks. To monitor the ongoing spread of B.1.1.7, our plots are available online.}

	abstract = {Background In December 2020, the United Kingdom (UK) reported a SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern (VoC) which is now coined B.1.1.7. Based on the UK data and later additional data from other countries, a transmission advantage of around 40-80\% was estimated for this variant [1, 2, 3].Aim The goal of this study is to estimate the transmission fitness advantage and the effective reproductive number of B.1.1.7 through time for data from Switzerland.Methods We collected genomic surveillance data from 11.8\% of all SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases across Switzerland between 14.12.2020 and 11.03.2021. It allows us to determine the relative proportion of the B.1.1.7 variant on a daily basis and to quantify the transmission advantage of the B.1.1.7 variant on a national and a regional scale.Results We propose a transmission advantage of 43-52\% of B.1.1.7 compared to the other circulating variants. Further, we estimate a reproductive number for B.1.1.7 above 1 for Jan. 1, 2021 until now while the reproductive number for the other variants was below 1. In particular, for the time period up to Jan. 17 we obtain a reproductive number of 1.24 [1.07-1.41] and from Jan. 18 until March 1 we obtain 1.18 [1.06-1.30] based on the whole genome sequencing data.

abstract = {Genome sequences from evolving infectious pathogens allow quantification of case introductions and local transmission dynamics. We sequenced 11,357 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes from Switzerland in 2020—the sixth largest effort globally. Using a representative subset of these data, we estimated viral introductions to Switzerland and their persistence over the course of 2020. We contrasted these estimates with simple null models representing the absence of certain public health measures. We show that Switzerland’s border closures decoupled case introductions from incidence in neighboring countries. Under a simple model, we estimate an 86 to 98\% reduction in introductions during Switzerland’s strictest border closures. Furthermore, the Swiss 2020 partial lockdown roughly halved the time for sampled introductions to die out. Last, we quantified local transmission dynamics once introductions into Switzerland occurred using a phylodynamic model. We found that transmission slowed 35 to 63\% upon outbreak detection in summer 2020 but not in fall. This finding may indicate successful contact tracing over summer before overburdening in fall. The study highlights the added value of genome sequencing data for understanding transmission dynamics. Phylogenetic and phylodynamic methods quantify the drop in case introductions and local transmission with implementation of public health measures. SARS-CoV-2 in SwitzerlandPhylogenomics has been key to understanding severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) dynamics. Nadeau et al. sequenced and analyzed thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from 2020 Switzerland during the early stages of the pandemic. They inferred that SARS-CoV-2 was introduced into the country by multiple independent introductions that fueled subsequent local viral transmission. Strict border closures were strongly linked to a reduction in SARS-CoV-2 importation into Switzerland, highlighting the importance of both viral genome sequencing and public health measures.—CAC}}

ABSTRACT = {In human beings, there are five reported variants of concern of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, in contrast to human beings, descriptions of infections of animals with specific variants are still rare. The aim of this study is to systematically investigate SARS-CoV-2 infections in companion animals in close contact with SARS-CoV-2-positive owners (&ldquo;COVID-19 households&rdquo;) with a focus on the Delta variant. Samples, obtained from companion animals and their owners were analyzed using a real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and next-generation sequencing (NGS). Animals were also tested for antibodies and neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2. Eleven cats and three dogs in nine COVID-19-positive households were RT-qPCR and/or serologically positive for the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant. For seven animals, the genetic sequence could be determined. The animals were infected by one of the pangolin lineages B.1.617.2, AY.4, AY.43 and AY.129 and between zero and three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected between the viral genomes of animals and their owners, indicating within-household transmission between animal and owner and in multi-pet households also between the animals. NGS data identified SNPs that occur at a higher frequency in the viral sequences of companion animals than in viral sequences of humans, as well as SNPs, which were exclusively found in the animals investigated in the current study and not in their owners. In conclusion, our study is the first to describe the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant transmission to animals in Switzerland and provides the first-ever description of Delta-variant pangolin lineages AY.129 and AY.4 in animals. Our results reinforce the need of a One Health approach in the monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 in animals.},

ABSTRACT = {The sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater is an unbiased method to detect the spread of emerging variants and to track regional infection dynamics, which is especially useful in case of limited testing and clinical sequencing. To test how major international events influence the spread of new variants we have sequenced SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the wastewater samples of Davos, Landquart, Lostallo, and St. Moritz in the Swiss canton of Grisons in the time around the international sports competitions in Davos and St. Moritz in December 2021, and additionally in May 2022 and January 2023 in Davos and St. Moritz during the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos. The prevalence of the variants identified from the wastewater sequencing data showed that the Omicron variant BA.1 had spread in Davos and St. Moritz during the international sporting events hosted there in December 2021. This spread was associated with an increase in case numbers, while it was not observed in Landquart and Lostallo. Another instance of new variant spread occurred during the WEF in January 2023, when the Omicron variant BA.2.75 arrived in Davos but not in St. Moritz. We can therefore conclude that major international events promote the spread of new variants in the respective host region, which has important implications for the protective measures that should be taken.},

	abstract = {Virus evolution is strongly affected by antagonistic co-evolution of virus and host. Host immune pathways positively select for viruses that evade the immune response, which in turn may drive counter-adaptations in host immune genes. We investigated how host immune pressure shapes virus populations and virulence, using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and one of its natural pathogens, Drosophila C virus (DCV), as a model. We performed an experimental evolution experiment in which DCV was serially passaged for 10 generations in three fly genotypes differing in their antiviral RNAi response, using wild-type flies and flies in which the endonuclease gene Dicer-2 was either overexpressed or inactivated. We found that all evolved virus populations replicated more efficiently in vivo and were more virulent than the parental stock. The number of polymorphisms increased in all three host genotypes with passage number, which was most pronounced in Dicer-2 knockout flies. Mutational analysis showed strong parallel evolution, as every lineage accumulated mutations in a specific region of the VP3 capsid protein in a host genotype-independent manner. The parental tyrosine at position 95 of VP3 was substituted with either one of five different amino acids in 14 out of 15 lineages. However, no consistent amino acid changes were observed in the viral RNAi suppressor gene 1A, nor elsewhere in the genome in any of the host backgrounds. Our study indicates that the RNAi response restricts the sequence space that can be explored by viral populations. Moreover, our study illustrates how evolution towards higher virulence can be a highly reproducible, yet unpredictable process.Significance statement The host immune response can have a major impact on the evolution of viruses. For instance, SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern have likely arisen in immunocompromised hosts. RNA interference (RNAi) is a potent antiviral immune-defense in insects, which we expect to likewise affect evolution of virus populations. To test this, we have either annulled or enhanced RNAi activity in fruit flies and serially passaged virus populations on these hosts. Our experimental evolution study revealed that the immune response constrains the sequence space that a virus can explore, and that a single amino acid change in the viral capsid can have a large impact on virulence and adaptation to the environment.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
